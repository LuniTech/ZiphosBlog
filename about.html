<h1>Why Did I Create This Blog?</h1>

A friend of mine once asked whether I had an online blog, and that's where most of my inspiration came from. Some of it also stemmed from the exciting prospect of accessing my thoughts and experiences from any location. Creating a blog allowed me to enhance the entries with features like pictures, audio, and links, making the whole process more engaging.

I could have easily created a pre-made blogger account, but I decided to work through a tutorial from scratch. Why, you might wonder? It was a valuable opportunity for me to engage in instructive and educational experiences, ultimately improving my skills and insights as a MERN stack developer. I've always found DIY projects to be more satisfying than simply buying ready-made products. Of course, the onus is on me to actively learn and understand the code rather than just copying and pasting it.

Undoubtedly, the modifications I made serve as evidence that I understand the code and can easily make improvements and adjustments to it.

<h1>Basic Information </h1>

My name is Innocent Lunika, and this blog serves as a collection of my thoughts, feelings, and views. I have various interests and occupations, and while I can't cover them all on this page, it's safe to say that I'm a very curious person. My curiosity extends to many aspects of life, and almost everything I do is a product of this innate trait.

Despite my wide-ranging interests, I consider myself a simple guy with straightforward tastes. Even if I had all the money in the world, I probably wouldn't display a lot of opulence. I'm reserved and unassuming, and you might find me full of surprises once you get to know me on a deeper level.

<h1>Technical Information and Technologies Used to Create This Blog</h1>

<ul>
<li>Frontend: The frontend of this blog is built using basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with some Bootstrap for styling buttons and other elements.</li>

<li>Backend: On the backend, I've used Node.js, combined with MongoDB and Mongoose, to store the entries and perform CRUD operations.</li>

<li>AWS Services: I've integrated some AWS services like Polly and S3 to create audio versions of some of the newer entries. It's important to note that AWS services may require payment for continued use after a year.</li>
<li>I avoided using AWS's polly as API for security reasons and to avoid extra costs</li>
<ul>
<h1>Authorship</h1>

I want to clarify that while I've made several modifications to the work, the primary authorship credit goes to the developer, Kyle Cooke through his youtube channel "Web dev simplified".

<h1>Hosting Information</h1>

I've chosen to host this Node.js application on Cyclic, which provides free hosting with SSL.
